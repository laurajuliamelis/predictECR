# FarmaPRED-PEP: Early Onset Response (EOR) Predictor

This Shiny web application provides a tool to predict the probability of early onset response (EOR) to antipsychotic treatment in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), based on clinical and cognitive data.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project is part of the FarmaPRED-PEP study, developed by the University of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, and CIBERSAM. It aims to support clinicians and researchers by providing interpretable, data-driven predictions using models trained on the PEPS cohort.

The study protocol can be found here: [TO BE DONE](http://www.google.com/)

> ℹ️ This tool is intended **for research purposes only** and must not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicted class (EOR/Non-EOR)
- Probability estimation of early response to antipsychotic treatment.
- Comparison against population probability distributions.
- Visual explanation of variable contributiom via SHAP values.
- Clean user interface with responsive design.
